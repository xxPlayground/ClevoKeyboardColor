# ClevoKeyboardColor

This program changes the color of the clevo keyboard.

I made this for a Clevo Branded Devices which comes with clevo control center. I have a single color rgb keyboard, but it should be fairly simple to adapt it to multi zone or per key keyboards. Let me know if you need help with that.

`InsydeDCHU.dll` needs to be added to the same folder as the exe. This file can be found in the installation directory of FnKey from the control center.
